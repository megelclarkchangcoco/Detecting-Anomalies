Step 1: Dataset Download and Setup
Dataset Selection
1.	Download a Dataset: Use a publicly available digital forensics dataset
2.	Load the Dataset into Python:

# Replace 'your_dataset.csv' with the actual path to your dataset file
data = pd.read_csv('your_dataset.csv')

"""Step 2: Data Exploration

"""

# prompt: 1.	Load the Dataset into Python
# o	Understand the dataset structure, check for missing values, and explore summary statistics

print(data.shape)

# Check for missing values

"""Step 6: Conclusion
1.	Summarize Results:

After completing the steps, we found significant insights from the dataset. We could preprocess and analyze digital evidence data effectively, identify unusual patterns or outliers, and create new features to enhance our analysis. Various techniques like Z-scores, Isolation Forest, and One-Class SVM proved invaluable in analyzing digital forensics data. Further feature engineering and selection methods such as correlation matrices and RFE helped refine our model training. Finally, using selected features, the model was trained to predict anomalies with considerable accuracy. This exercise emphasized the crucial role of proper data preprocessing, the significance of choosing the right anomaly detection methods, and the impact of careful feature selection on the results.

This methodology demonstrates the powerful application of machine learning in enhancing digital forensic investigations
